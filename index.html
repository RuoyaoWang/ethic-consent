	<h2>3.	What is the purpose of the preject?</h2>
	<p>The aim of the research is to build skill taxonomy on crowdsourcing platform by understanding what skills workers have; whether workers are proficient in these skills and their views on the task. The survey will be conducted for a few days. This is not for an educational qualification. </p >

	<h2>4.	Why have I been chosen?</h2>
	<p>Participants will volunteer to participate in the survey. This survey will have 100 volunteers.</p >

	<h2>5.	Do I have to take part?</h2>
	<p>It is up to you to decide whether or not to take part. If you do decide to take part you will be given this information sheet to keep (and be asked to sign a consent form).

	<h2>6.	What will happen to me if I take part? What do I have to do?</h2>
	<p>Participants will complete a questionnaire. It takes about 15 minutes to complete this document.
	I will conduct a questionnaire survey of participants to understand the situation of workers looking for work on crowdsourcing platforms. The researcher wants to know what skills workers are looking for on a crowdsourcing platform; whether workers are proficient in these skills; and whether the worker is enjoy to finish the task. By collecting and analysing these data, it can effectively help the platform to establish a more reasonable skill taxonomy.
